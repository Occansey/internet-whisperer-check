    content: `Six years ago, Growth Supply was born with an ambitious mission: accelerating the solar transition in Africa.

Since then, our expertise has developed around two key strategic steps:

ðŸ”¹ Energy transition: With five committed partners, we have launched around thirty solar projects across five African countries, providing clean energy to thousands of households and businesses. The result? Over 37,000 lives transformed through access to reliable and sustainable electricity and 15 million USD investment secured.

ðŸ”¹ Digital transformation: The acquisition of MFG Technologies in Canada and the creation of our subsidiary Asking, specializing in data visualization and analysisâ€”far beyond the energy sectorâ€”have opened up new opportunities in North America.

Today, our vision and ambitions have grown. Growth Supply becomes Solio Group.

This new identity reflects our commitment to offering sustainable and technological solutions to shape a better future.

Why Solio?

ðŸ”† Sol: The Sunâ€”source of clean energy and a symbol of transformation toward a sustainable future.

ðŸš€ Io: Digital at the heart of our mission.

"Solio Group embodies a bold vision: a sustainable and connected future, where innovation drives change. This new name reflects the expansion of our offer, combining solar energy and digital solutions to address Africa's energy challenges while opening our market to North America. We are taking action, determined to play a decisive role in Africa's solar transition and to make a real and immediate impact on the ground."

â€” Evrard Havyarimana, President of Solio Group

The future is solar. The future is digital.

    content: `Digital transformation projects often involve profound changes to processes, systems and ways of working within an organisation.

Without effective change management, these initiatives can be met with significant resistance from employees, leading to delays, budget overruns and, in the worst case, total project failure.

If you're not sure where to start, here are the keys to effective change management.

The keys to effective change management
Change management involves anticipating, planning for and managing the organisational and human impacts associated with the adoption of new technology.

This includes communicating project objectives transparently, training employees to acquire the necessary skills and creating an environment that encourages acceptance and adoption of change.

To effectively manage change management in the implementation of digital tools, several key steps need to be followed.

Identify the objective of the change: Clearly identify what you want to change and what you need to work towards, whether in financial, marketing or HR terms.
Carry out an audit to determine the need for change: Analyse the current situation to understand the source of the need and identify potential resistance to change.
Implement change: Designate a responsible team, communicate transparently, organise training workshops and use collaborative tools to ensure that objectives are monitored and achieved.
Adaptive management: Make teams accountable, define clear objectives and give meaning to tasks.
Change management: Monitor the adoption of change, measure its effectiveness and adjust if necessary.
These steps are generic but essential, but don't hesitate to adapt them to the reality of your situation and, above all, keep your door open to suggestions.

Adaptability and vision in change management
When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he led the company to a series of successes thanks to his bold vision. His approach led to the creation of iconic products and to the company being valued at unprecedented levels.

The key lesson from this experience is to stay true to the original vision while accepting the evolution necessary to remain competitive.

In the context of an SME and a project, it is important to maintain the fundamental vision while adapting the company to meet changing needs.

It's about returning to the company's distinctive vision, and then finding ways to progressively improve its execution.

The change management process starts by identifying a starting point, determining the desired direction and adjusting the business strategy accordingly.

Adaptability, essential for survival in a constantly changing market.
Business leaders must therefore maintain their vision while making the necessary changes to remain competitive.

Adopting a new tool within an organisation is essential to achieving efficiency and innovation.

For the transition to be successful, it is necessary to understand employee needs, ensure transparent communication, involve stakeholders, provide adequate training and ongoing support, and encourage adoption by highlighting the benefits of the tools, customising features and respecting privacy and data rights.

To facilitate the integration of a new tool while ensuring the well-being of everyone and the performance of your organisation, don't hesitate to follow these tips.`
